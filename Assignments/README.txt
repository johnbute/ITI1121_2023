Description: This directory consists of a parking-lot simulator
that is capable of designing a parking lot and its type of spaces based on user input,
then proceeds to populate the parking lot with cars based on the car's position
and type. Furthermore, the program can detect whether parking 
is possible, calculate total amount of occupancy, and total amount of capacity.
